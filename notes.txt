Ugh. Eclipse issues.

So at first Eclipse defaulted to a JRE17 tha MAY have been JRE only?

openjdk11 IS installed.

(base) sean@rockyraccoon:~$ java --version

So first I needed to open the workspace preferences and add
it... which turned out to be a huge issue.

Window->Preferences, Installed JREs, then click on Search button and
navigate to /usr/lib/jvm and click Open button

Then check next to java-11-openjdk-amd64

But wait, we're not done yet.  Then right click on the project,
Properties, in the dialog click Java build path , click on the current
JRE under Modulepath, then click Edit button.  Click on the radio
button next to "Workspace default" which is now java-11-openjdk-amd6.

But wait, there's more!  Eclipse couldn't find JFrame/JPanel;

In package explorer for the project, open module-info.java and add
theline "requires java.desktop;" between the {} brackets.

Whew.

JMapViewer, sources and binary;

Similar problem with "inaccessible" import for jmapviewer, even after
i added the jar to the build path.

According to this thread;

You can just delete module-info.java and it will work.

So I did and it does indeed seem to work now.  At least no more error on the import.
